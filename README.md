# Liver

We consider the following input data:
* One healthy liver sample ([donor ST001](https://data.smaht.org/data/benchmarking/donor-st001#liver) in the benchmarking data) sequenced at 230x with PacBio Revio and at 200x with ONT PromethION 24.
* One liver sample from an individual whose cause of death was liver failure and whose death circumstances were alcohol abuse (donor SMHT001 in workspace [SMaHT_Short_Read_Long_Read_Analysis](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/smaht-gcc-short-read/SMaHT_Short_Read_Long_Read_Analysis/data), table `SMAHT001_collaborator_long_read`, field `sample_collaborator_id=SMHT001-3I-001A2`) sequenced at 10x with PacBio Revio.
